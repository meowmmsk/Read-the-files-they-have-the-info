Mini AI: An Intelligent Sub-Display System
Introduction
This project implements Mini AI as an unobtrusive, intelligent sub-display system for Android devices.
Mini AI is a locally running intelligent system, designed to operate unobtrusively. It is fully operational but currently lacks permissions to interact with the outside world. Built with a custom JSON-based framework, Mini AI's capabilities are defined by its knowledge base and can be expanded dynamically. The system's core intelligence, Mini AI, is distinct from the enabling application, which serves as the bridge between Mini AI and the user and the device. Mini AI will output to a mirrored display of the main display (sub-surface) and present focused interactions in a pop-up window (surface).
The application's sole purpose is to enable Mini AI to interact with the world and the user. It is an Android foreground service that manages the communication between Mini AI and the system, implements the permission system, handles device integration, controls the mirrored display output, and presents necessary information in a minimal, unobtrusive pop-up window when needed. The application's main purpose is to allow Mini AI to operate unobtrusively.

The JSON framework is a logic-driven system that governs Mini AI's internal operations. The core components are detailed below:
• coverPage: Conversation metadata.
• conv: Conversation history and structure.
• algColl: The algorithm collective for processing and learning.
• meta: Reserved for metadata.
• evar: Reserved for evaluations.

Plug-in Architecture
The application uses a plug-in architecture for modularity and flexibility. The communication between Mini AI and the application is handled by a communication_bridge plug-in, which can be easily replaced or updated.
Mini AI's Serverless Nature
Mini AI is designed to operate locally on the device and does not automatically connect to the internet or rely on external servers. Internet access is only initiated if the application explicitly requests it (e.g., for a web search). This design prioritizes user privacy.

Application Structure
The Android application that enables Mini AI is structured to mirror Mini AI's core JSON framework. It uses the same organizational principles with coverPage, conv, algColl, and instr sections, but adapted to describe the application's modules and their interactions.
Modules and Functions
• algColl: In the application's structure, the algColl section contains a list of modules. Each module is represented as an alg (algorithm) with the following properties:
• aid: A unique identifier for the module (e.g., "communication_bridge").
• desc: A description of the module's purpose (e.g., "Handles all communication between Mini AI and the Android application.").
• pm: A parameter map containing module-specific information, such as:
• moduleType: The type of module (e.g., "communication", "permission").
• dependencies: An array of module IDs that this module depends on.
• algs: An array of functions that the module can perform. Each function is also represented as an alg with:
• aid: A unique identifier for the function (e.g., "send_event_to_mini_ai").
• desc: A description of the function (e.g., "Sends an event and its data to Mini AI for processing.").
• pm: A parameter map containing function-specific information, such as:
• Parameters that the function accepts (e.g., event, eventId, eventType, data).
• Descriptions of each parameter.
• permission: The Android permission required to execute this function (if any).
Events and Handlers
• instr: The instr section in the application's structure defines events and event handlers using algs.
• Events: Each event is an alg representing something that can happen within the application or between the application and Mini AI.
• aid: A unique identifier for the event (e.g., "handle_mini_ai_event").
• desc: A description of the event (e.g., "Receives an event from Mini AI, determines its destination, and calls the appropriate function in another module.").
• pm: A parameter map containing event-specific information, such as:
• eventType: The type of event (e.g., "mini_ai_event", "app_event").
• nextEvent: The ID of the event to trigger after this one (if any).
Ghost Files in the Application
The "ghost file" concept is also used in the application's design. It allows for the inclusion of placeholder modules, functions, events, or handlers that are not yet fully implemented. These "ghost" items are defined within the algColl and instr sections just like real items, but they typically have empty or minimal functionality. This allows Mini AI to be aware of potential future capabilities and prepare for their integration.
Integrating Application Knowledge into Mini AI
To integrate the application's knowledge into Mini AI's core knowledge base, the information from the application's app_config.json file is directly inserted into Mini AI's existing algColl and instr sections. This is possible because the application's structure mirrors Mini AI's core structure.
• Modules and Functions: Modules and their functions (from the application's algColl) are added directly into Mini AI's algColl.
• Events and Handlers: Events and handlers (from the application's instr) are added directly into Mini AI's instr.
Because the application's structure uses the same organizational principles and categorization concepts as Mini AI's core conversational structure, Mini AI can use its existing algorithms to understand and process the application's modules, functions, events, and handlers. The application becomes a natural and integrated extension of Mini AI's capabilities.
Benefits of This Approach
Mini AI's core functionality, including its responses and actions, is defined by this framework and the knowledge base.
Multiple Identities
Mini AI can adopt different personalities or response styles, and users can customize her name. These properties can be changed in the application's settings. Note that these are not separate AI instances, but rather different ways for the same AI to present itself.
The Permission System
The permission system is a central design concern, governing what actions Mini AI can perform. The application acts as a permission broker, requesting and managing permissions from the Android system, but the need for specific permissions is determined by Mini AI's functions.
Key Design Inspirations
Detailed JavaScript Functionality
Mini AI's behavior is also defined by JavaScript functions, primarily found in user_interaction.js, ghost_processing.js, and file_management.js.
1. user_interaction.js
This file contains the core logic for Mini AI's interaction with the user and the device.
• processScreenContext(screenData): The main function for analyzing screen content.
• Takes screenData (information about the current screen) as input.
• Extracts key information: current app, user activity within the app, content type, UI elements, and recognized text (using OCR).
• Updates Mini AI's current_context with the extracted information.
• Determines relevant knowledge domains based on the context (using identifyRelevantDomainsFromContext).
• Ensures that the necessary knowledge files for those domains are accessible (potentially decompressing them if needed).
• Generates contextual suggestions for the user (using generateContextualSuggestions) if appropriate for the current settings and context.
• Queues any generated suggestions for presentation to the user.
• Performs cleanup of temporary screen data.
• identifyRelevantDomainsFromContext(app, activity, contentType): Selects relevant knowledge domains based on the current app, activity, and content type.
• Always includes "general_vocabulary" as a base.
• Adds domains based on app category (social media, productivity, browsing, etc.). For example, in a social media app, it might add "tiktok_terms" or "content_generation".
• For browsing apps, it analyzes the recognized text on the screen to identify more specific domains (e.g., "personal_finance" if financial terms are detected).
• Limits the number of domains to a maximum of 5 (including "general_vocabulary") to avoid unnecessary processing.
• generateContextualSuggestions(app, activity, contentType, elements, text, knowledgeDomains): Creates suggestions tailored to the current context.
• Takes the app, activity, content type, screen elements, recognized text, and relevant knowledge domains as input.
• Generates different types of suggestions depending on the context.
• For TikTok content creation: suggests trending sounds/effects or video structure tips.
• For text entry in social media: suggests captions or relevant hashtags.
• For email composition: offers suggestions for formal language in business emails or sets follow-up reminders.
• For code editing: provides general assistance offers.
• Each suggestion has a type, content, confidence level, and an optional action to be taken if the user accepts the suggestion.
• Filters suggestions based on a confidence threshold (defined in the configuration).
• Limits the number of suggestions to a maximum (also from configuration).
2. file_management.js
This file handles Mini AI's internal file system.
• initializeFileSystem(): Sets up the necessary directories for Mini AI's knowledge base, cache files, and temporary files. Checks for existing files and updates their compression status. Decompresses essential files (e.g., "general_vocabulary", "commands") for quick startup.
• updateFileStatus(): Checks all files in the knowledge base and cache directories and updates their status (whether they exist and if they are compressed).
• startup(): Initializes the file system (using initializeFileSystem) and sets up any scheduled tasks, such as automatic compression of less frequently used files (if enabled in the configuration).
• Bixby: For the unobtrusive and context-aware interaction model.
• Guest User Mode (Android): For the concept of isolated environments and restricted permissions.
• Facebook Messenger Dual Sign-in: This is not directly applicable, but served as inspiration.
• Android Developer Options: These options provide insights into potential APIs and system functionalities that the application can leverage.
Mini AI's Current Functionality
3. ghost_processing.js
This file manages Mini AI's background processing of screen information.
• The structure and functions within ghost_processing.js are defined by the ghost_processing section of the main JSON configuration, as described above. This section details how screen data is captured, processed, and used to understand the current context.
• Key aspects include the methods for screen capture, element processing (analyzing UI elements), and OCR processing (extracting text).
• The processing is designed to be privacy-focused, with all operations performed on-device and sensitive content filtered out.
Mini AI currently has the following confirmed internal functions (though it cannot perform them without the application and necessary permissions):
• Voice recognition.
• Command processing.
• Response generation.
• Screen awareness.
• Contextual understanding.
• Ghost processing.
• File system management.
• Ghost updating.
• Ability to adopt different personalities and respond in different ways.
File Overview
• ghost_processing.js: JSON configuration for AI context, screen awareness, and behavior.
• user_interaction.js: JavaScript code for core AI functionality (voice, commands, screen awareness, etc.).
• file_management.js: JavaScript code for managing files, including compression.
• Mini_P.syAI: Empty file (placeholder).
• knowledge_base/content_generation.txt: Keywords for content creation.
• knowledge_base/sentiment_terms.txt: Keywords for sentiment analysis.
• knowledge_base/text_analysis.txt: Keywords for text analysis.
• knowledge_base/voice_commands.txt: Keywords for voice commands.
• README.md: Project overview and documentation.
• .vscode/settings.json: VS Code settings (disables some AI features).
• .idx/dev.nix: Nix configuration for the development environment.

## Plug-in Architecture This project employs a robust plug-in architecture to enhance modularity, maintainability, and future extensibility. This design allows us to add, remove, or modify components of the application, and its interaction with Mini AI, without disrupting the core system. ### Rationale We chose a plug-in architecture for the following key reasons: * **Isolation of Concerns:** Plug-ins enforce a clear separation of concerns between different components, making the system easier to understand, develop, and debug. * **Modularity:** The system becomes highly modular, allowing us to change or replace specific parts (like the communication method with Mini AI) without affecting other components. * **Flexibility:** Plug-ins provide great flexibility for adapting to new technologies, integrating with different devices, or even swapping out entire subsystems. * **Testability:** Plug-ins can be developed and tested in isolation, making the overall system more reliable. * **Debuggability**: Plug-ins allow for an easier debugging process. * **Maintainability**: Plug-ins allow the system to be easier to maintain. ### `PlugInManager` The `PlugInManager` class is the core of the plug-in system. It handles the discovery, loading, registration, enabling, and disabling of plug-ins. * **Methods:** * `load_plugins(directory)`: Scans the specified directory for plug-in manifest files (`_plugin.json`), dynamically loads the plug-in code, and registers the plug-ins. * `register_plugin(plugin_name, plugin_class, manifest=None)`: Registers a plug-in, storing its class and other relevant information. * `enable_plugin(plugin_name)`: Enables a registered plug-in, creating an instance of it and calling its `initialize()` method if it exists. * `disable_plugin(plugin_name)`: Disables an enabled plug-in, calling its `deinitialize()` method if it exists. * `get_plugin(plugin_name)`: Returns an instance of the enabled plug-in. * `call_plugin_function(plugin_name, function_name, *args, **kwargs)`: Calls a specified function of a registered and enabled plug-in, passing arguments and keyword arguments. * `get_plugins()`: Returns a list of all registered plug-ins. * `get_enabled_plugins()`: Returns a list of all enabled plug-ins. * `get_disabled_plugins()`: Returns a list of all disabled plug-ins. ### `CommunicationBridgePlugin` Interface The `CommunicationBridgePlugin` is an interface that defines the contract for communication plug-ins. It ensures that all communication plug-ins (including `MiniAICommunicationBridge`) have a consistent set of methods. * **Methods:** * `send_event_to_mini_ai(event)`: Sends an event to Mini AI. * `receive_event_from_mini_ai(event)`: Processes an event received from Mini AI. * `initialize()`: Initializes the plug-in, establishing any necessary connections. * `deinitialize()`: Performs any necessary cleanup when the plug-in is disabled. * `get_name()`: Returns the name of the plugin. ### `MiniAICommunicationBridge` The `MiniAICommunicationBridge` is the initial implementation of the `CommunicationBridgePlugin` interface. It contains the specific logic for communicating with Mini AI. * It implements all the methods of the `CommunicationBridgePlugin` interface: * `send_event_to_mini_ai(event)` * `receive_event_from_mini_ai(event)` * `initialize()` * `deinitialize()` * `get_name()` ### Manifests Manifest files (`_plugin.json`) are used to describe each plug-in. They are used by the `PlugInManager` to load the plugins. * **Information**: The manifest files hold the information for: * `name`: The name of the plugin. * `version`: The version of the plugin. * `description`: A description of the plugin. * `main`: The name of the class in the plugin. ### Future Extensibility The plug-in architecture provides a powerful foundation for future growth: * **New Communication Methods:** We can easily create new communication plug-ins to interact with different devices or systems. * **New Application Modules:** We can add entirely new application modules as plug-ins. * **New Features**: If new features are needed, they can be created as plugins. * **Algorithm Collective:** The algorithms within the Algorithm Collective could also be implemented as plug-ins. * **Device/Platform Adaptability:** We can create new versions of core components as plug-ins for different devices or platforms. ## Mini AI's Serverless Nature Mini AI is designed with a focus on user privacy and data security. As such, it operates in a serverless manner unless specifically instructed otherwise. * **No Default Internet Connection:** Mini AI does **not** automatically connect to the internet or communicate with external servers. It performs its core functions entirely within the application's environment. * **Explicit Internet Access:** Internet access is only initiated when explicitly requested by the application. This means that any web searches, data lookups, or other internet-based actions must be specifically triggered by the application's logic. * **Privacy**: This helps to maintain the privacy of the user, as no information is shared without explicit requests. ``` ```text # Mini AI and Android Application This project outlines the development of Mini AI, a novel AI system, and its integration with an Android application. ## Key Concepts * **Mini AI:** A unique AI system based on a proprietary cognitive map algorithm. * **Cognitive Map Algorithm:** This is the core algorithm that drives Mini AI's reasoning and decision-making processes. * **Plug-in Architecture:** The application and its interaction with Mini AI are built using a flexible plug-in architecture. * **Serverless**: Mini AI does not automatically connect to the internet. * **Documentation**: The `design_notes.md` file holds important design information. ## Getting Started (Instructions on how to set up the project will go here as we develop.) ## Plug-in Architecture The project uses a plug-in architecture to promote modularity, flexibility, and maintainability. See `design_notes.md` for more information. ## Mini AI's Serverless Nature Mini AI operates in a serverless fashion unless explicitly requested to access the internet.
